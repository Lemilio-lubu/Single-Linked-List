A linked list is a sequential arrangement of nodes within a linear data structure. Each individual node consists of two components: [DATA | NEXT NODE]. A specific variant of a linked list is the Single Linked List, which possesses a distinct attribute: the final node within the sequence points to null in the next node field.
